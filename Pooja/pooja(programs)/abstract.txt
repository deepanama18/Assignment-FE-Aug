Today we are in a generation where everyone is
dependent to perform most of their tasks using computers,
thus making it an integral part of our life. Though computers
have been with us through several decades, still we follow the
same, old, primitive methods such as a mouse, keyboard, etc.to
interact with them. Also, there is a wide range of health
problems that affect many people, caused by the constant and
continuous work with the computer. 
This is where HumanComputer Interaction provides us a solution that focuses
on the interfaces between users and computers by researching
the design and use of computer technology, which involves
using human gestures which constitute a space of motion
expressed by the body, face, and/or hands. Among a variety of
gestures, hand gestures are the most expressive and the most
frequently used. The focus of creating hand gestures is to
create better communication between humans and computers
for conveying information. The proposed project aims to
create a gesture-controlled media player wherein we can use
our hands and control the video played on the computer.
Rather than using simple image processing and machine
learning, with the help of deep learning and neural networks
several combinations of hand gestures can be recognized with
increased accuracy by using the CNN.
